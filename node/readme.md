# Node Backend for Backbone.js Employee Directory #

This is a node.js backend for the "Backbone Directory" sample application.  This node.js backend uses the same MySQL datastore as the PHP backend.
This backend also serves the static client-side files needed for the sample, so no additional web server is required.

## Set Up: ##

1. Create and populate the MySQL database, as described in main readme file.
2. Start up the node.js-based application server

	- cd backbone-directory/node
	- npm install
	- node app.js
	
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
